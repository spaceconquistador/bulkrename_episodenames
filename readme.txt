BULK RENAMING FILES

I am learning python and this is my first python program. Any feedback would be
greatly appreciated.

About the Program:

The program was created so that I could bulk rename video files of a TV series
on my computer. I wanted to automate the process of capturing episode name info
from animelist, wikipedia or imdb and then using that to rename the video file into
a following  format:

e.g. 01 - Firstepisode.mkv, 02 - Secondepisode.mkv

The program only works if the episodes are already in the correct order within
the target directory. It also only renames mkv, avi or mp4 files.

Only tested on Linux.
